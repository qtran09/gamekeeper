## GameKeeper
Keep track of game results for each day, recording wins, losses, opponents, and any observations from a game. Made using the MERN stack 

Possibilities include:

### `Create multiple calendars`

Create different calendars for different games, playstyles, etc. Select which calendar you're viewing using a list on the sidebar of the main page.

### `Add "events"`

Per calendar, you can add "events" which are small notes about a match you've played. You can view these in a list by clicking on the day you make the event for.

### `(FUTURE) Share calendars with others for them to observe`

Future plan is to be able to share calendars with others. This would be especially useful if you're part of a team and want to share your notes with others.
